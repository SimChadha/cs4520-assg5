To run this project, open the project in Android studio and select an emulator to run the app on.
If not done already, clean the project. Before running the app, make sure you have run
the proper gradle tasks when the IDE prompts at the top.
From there, run the app from Android studio using the default configuration to start to app.
The default configuration will run on the module Assignment4.app.main and will launch the
